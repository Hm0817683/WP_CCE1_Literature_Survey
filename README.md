**Project Details**



**Tentative Title:** Image Processing Methods for Luggage/Baggage Threat Detection.  

**Domain:** Computer Vision / Security Screening.

**Sub-Domain:** X-ray / CT baggage scanning; Automatic Threat Recognition (ATR); Deep learning for prohibited item detection.

**Objective Description:** To survey published approaches for automatic detection and recognition of prohibited items in luggage using X-ray and CT imagery, compare methods (classical image processing, machine learning, and deep learning), and identify gaps for adaptive ATR systems, segmentation + detection techniques, multispectral X-ray analysis, and dataset/benchmark needs.



**PICO Format:**

Each paper in this survey has been analyzed using the PICO framework:  

&nbsp;	P: Problem Statement  

&nbsp;	I: Intervention / Method used  

&nbsp;	C: Comparison with other works  

&nbsp;	O: Outcome / Results
